<h1> Benjamin Malley </h1>

<p class="biography"> My story begins at the dawn of time in the faraway realm of alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of my many stops on a lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don't care if it blows up, because I'll just be ice floating through space, like a comet. </p>
